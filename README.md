# To run

 - npm install

 - npm run dev

 This project has a json file named jobs.json in the src folder. I have prepared that as a sample to
 view the project without having to build the back-end from the ground up.
    By running the command 
  - npm run server
    you can get the json mock server which acts as a back-end.
    
 This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
